1) Modified grub defaults file to suite AMD IOMMU 

	GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash amd_iommu=on iommu=soft"


2) Added a line in alsa config file seems to add a sound card. The fact is that it's adding the wrong one.

3) I also manually added hw:0,0 (automatically detected by module-udev-detect) in pulse configuration adding

	load-module module-alsa-source device=hw:1,0

A thread on ALSA in  https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=125092 seems to say how to solve this.

Setting manually to load 
	
	(pulseaudio config file)
	load-module module-alsa-source device=hw:0,0 
	
	(pulseaudio config file)
	nothing, removed the line  "options snd-hda-intel model=generic"

seems to use the microphone to do stuff, including output.

So i try to get the mic working. On https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture/Troubleshooting#Microphone
I found that adding 

	options snd-hda-intel enable_msi=1
	
to /etc/modprobe.d/snd-hda-intel.conf should fix the issue. But it doesnt.



Found that 

	alsactl init
	and
	alsactl restore
	
give information about errors during hardware loading.


I think that adding myself to the audio group is the first thing i have done, but i repeated

usermod -a -G audio djanloo

4)Tried blacklisting mic, failed.


5) Tried adding in alsa config file:

	options snd-hda-intel index=1,0

as suggested in https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=186597.

During alsa force-reload, unloading modules get stuck at snd-rn-pci-acp3x driver.

Interestingly enough, I get

	$ lsmod | grep snd_rn_pci_acp3x
	
	snd_rn_pci_acp3x       20480  -1
	snd_acp_config         16384  1 snd_rn_pci_acp3x

which means that the driver is not used by anyone.

Furthermore

$ pacmd list-cards
1 card(s) available.
    index: 0
	name: <alsa_card.pci-0000_03_00.1>
	driver: <module-alsa-card.c>

		device.bus_path = "pci-0000:03:00.1"

This confirms that pulseaudio can't see nothing

5) Finally some explicit references to analog device appeared restarting pulseaudio with high verbosity:

	$ pulseaudio -vvvv

	[...]
	I: [pulseaudio] (alsa-lib)main.c: error: failed to import hw:1 use case configuration -6
	I: [pulseaudio] (alsa-lib)parser.c: UCM is not supported for this HDA model (HD-Audio Generic at 0xd03c0000 irq 71)

	D: [pulseaudio] alsa-util.c: Trying iec958:1 with SND_PCM_NO_AUTO_FORMAT ...
	[...]

from which it seems that UCM is not provided for my audio card.

6) Then I found out that is a bad idea to have a user in the audio group (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Audio/TheAudioGroup) and deleted myself with 

	sudo deluser djanloo audio

I deleted the config files for pulseaudio at ~/.config/pulse.
Now the pulseaudio startup log doesn't seem to have problems in finding the analog.
Still have a 
	
	Failed to load module "module-native-protocol-unix" (argument: ""): initialization failed.

7) Tried adding myself to the pulse group. Nothing changed.

8) Discovered that the analog package has nothing to do with sound.

9) Started following the ubuntu sound troubleshooting guide and done

sudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get dist-upgrade; sudo apt-get install pavucontrol linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils gdm3 ubuntu-desktop  linux-image-`uname -r` libasound2; sudo apt-get -y --reinstall install linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils gdm3 ubuntu-desktop  linux-image-`uname -r` libasound2; killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse*; ubuntu-support-status || ubuntu-security-status; sudo usermod -aG `cat /etc/group | grep -e '^pulse:' -e '^audio:' -e '^pulse-access:' -e '^pulse-rt:' -e '^video:' | awk -F: '{print $1}' | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's:,$::g'` `whoami`

Since it created problems on kernel 5.18 I switched to 5.15.0-27-generic and seemed to work.

Maybe accidentally deleted alsa-base.conf file while trying to purge.

10)Executed

cat /proc/asound/{version,cards,devices,hwdep,pcm,seq/clients}; ls -l /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/; sudo rm /etc/asound.conf; sudo rm -r ~/.pulse ~/.asound* ;sudo rm ~/.pulse-cookie; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install aptitude; sudo aptitude install paman gnome-alsamixer libasound2-plugins padevchooser libsdl1.2debian-pulseaudio; sudo lshw -short;ls -lart /dev/snd; find /lib/modules/`uname -r` | grep snd ;cat /dev/sndstat; lspci -nn; lsusb; sudo which alsactl; sudo fuser -v /dev/dsp /dev/snd/* ; dpkg -S bin/slmodemd; dmesg | egrep 'EMU|probe|emu|ALSA|alsa|ac97|udi|snd|ound|irmware'; sudo systemctl list-units |egrep 'EMU|probe|emu|ALSA|alsa|ac97|udi|snd|ound|irmware|bcm|card|Card'; sudo /etc/init.d/sl-modem-daemon status; sudo grep model /etc/modprobe.d/* ; sudo dmidecode|egrep 'anufact|roduct|erial|elease'; lsmod | egrep 'snd|usb|midi|udio'; pacmd list-sinks; aplay -l; sudo alsa force-reload; ubuntu-support-status || ubuntu-security-status ; sudo lshw -C sound

This gave problems in

	sudo alsa force-reload 
	
since this command freezes when unloadings nd-pci-acp3x. 

I realized that this guide seems pretty old, stopped following it.

11) Added 

	#DJANLOO
	blacklist snd-rn-pci-acp3x
	
in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf ans suggested in https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-T400-T500-and-newer-T-series-Laptops/T14s-AMD-no-HDMI-audio-on-Linux/m-p/5081195?page=7

now alsa force-reload seems to work. Still I have only one device listed in aplay -l.

Then added 
	
	snd-acp3x-pdm-dma

in /etc/modules-load.d/audio.conf.

Next step would be to manually do 

	modprobe snd-rn-pci-acp3x
	
to get the mic working. Naturally this entire procedure does not work.


12) Completely random uninstalled pipewire this apparently uninstalled the ubuntu-desktop package.

Reinstalled pipewire and ubuntu-desktop.

############## DEBIAN #############

Tried deleting all and installing debian (kern5.10, probably too old).

Turns out that non-free firmware is required for network, rtw88 stuff.

I could not reach internet on debian.

alsa was not installed, still aplay and arecord got the same output as on ubuntu 22.04.
Stats for debian are in debian/stats.

No particular boot error was shown.
lshw was not installed.
